title: Components
lead: Understand how to use the component pages
---

Each component page includes examples of basic usage, as well as demos where interesting or useful features are brought to the fore.

The first item on the page will always demonstrate a simple use case. If a callback is required for basic functionality, it will be included here too. If not, an example on how to use callbacks (if appropriate to the component) is included below.

{{example:components/main/simple.py:layout}}


Each example demonstrates the component in use within an app at the top, then below, the corresponding python code. If it's available, code to create the same component in R or Julia can be seen by clicking the appropriate tabs.

It's important to note that this example is not a fully functioning app, and will only work within a dash app. *You will not be able to run the example as is*.

If you are unsure how to get the examples to work, please take a look at the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/) instructions for creating a basic app.
